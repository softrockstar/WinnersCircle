# WinnersCircleFAQ
I used <a href=https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Run-RipMe>RipMe</a> to grab about 3800 images from the sub. About 1GB.

<a href=http://www.andreaplanet.com/andreamosaic/>AndreaMosaic</a> was useed to generate the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic>photomosaic</a>.

The <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/piim1z/winners_circle/>image posted to Reddit</a> drew from all of the downloaded images, but its layout used fewer (~3700). I believe repeats were capped at 5. What this means is: it doesn't depict every single HCA post. Using every image as a unique tile means the set of tiles is mostly white or black walls of text, with faces probably being a predominant picture element, and colors drawn from a pretty small random pool.

Ideally this would be a live thing in the cloud that updates and regenerates weekly, or on-demand over a range of dates, etc. yadda yadda, knobs-to-twiddle.
